# This file defines the menu links for your GitHub Pages site.
# It is organized into two sections: Internal Jumps (for the single-page layout)
# and External Links (for professional resources).

# --- Internal Navigation (Anchors on the index.html page) ---
# To use these, ensure the corresponding sections in index.html have an ID,
# e.g., <section id="about">...</section>
